  "description": "Expands your inventory space to 15 rows by 25 columns = 375 total slots.  Also adds four special slots to hold ender pearls, ender chest, clock, and compass.  A keybinding is added to use the ender pearl from this slot (regardless of what is in your hotbar).  You can store experience by filling Bottles o Enchanting by putting empty bottles in a special slot in the far right.  The two buttons on the top right deposit your items into nearby chests automatically.  Also includes a 3x3 crafting grid instead of 2x2.  Some bits of code are forked from the open source repository at https://github.com/Funwayguy/InfiniteInvo (Which is a completely different 1.7 mod not by me).  ",
