  "description": "Add four command blocks in survival with pre-set commands that can never be changed.  These are meant for single player survival worlds.   On servers, you can use these without being an OP, so be warned.   One block always executes /toggledownfall, the other three toggle a game rule: naturalRegeneration, doFireTick, mobGriefing, doDaylightCycle.  (access to the other game rules did not feel balanced for regular survival play)",
