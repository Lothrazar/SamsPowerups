  "description": "The Master wand is made with four blaze rods in a Y shape, and an Emerald Block; and it has five main functions.  Each use will use some durability, and drain some hunger too.

1:Chest Transportation: It turns any chest into a Sack of Holding that saves the chests items; you then can place the sack back down as a chest with the items in the same locations.  
2: Replant and Harvest: Use on a field and it will harvest any ripe wheat, carrots and potatoes, while also replanting them using some of the loot.  A huge timesaver for big plots.
3: Spawn Eggs: Turns certain passive (adult) mobs into their spawn eggs: Pigs, Sheep, Cows, Mooshrooms, and Bats.  (Sheep will forget their color).
4: Prospecting: Hit it on smoothstone and it will prospect for diamond ore, but only looks out in a handful of nearby blocks.  A minor timesaver while branch mining.
5: Finding Dungeons : Hit it on a Diamond block and it will search in nearby chunks for the closest spawner.  If found, it does not tell you the exact coordinates, only the distance you are away and the elevation.",
