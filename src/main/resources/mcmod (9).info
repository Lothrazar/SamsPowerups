  "description": "Adds useful info to your F3 debug screen.  It tells you if you are in a slime chunk; if you are in a village it tells you the village center and other details; lists enabled game rules; and displays horse speed and jump height.  By defualt it also disables existing debug screen which hides your XYZ coordinates - makes for an interesting challenge.  Also adds a command: type /todo to add a custom reminder message that will be displayed on the right side of the screen.  Customize these in the config file.",
