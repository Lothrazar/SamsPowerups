1.3.3

-effectpay bugfixes: was not calculating and blocking/draining experience correctly

-new command /bind for macros

    simply run /bind /toggledownfall or /bind /effectpay 41 10, or any other command
    and that key is now bound to the macro key (default G)

1.3.2 - done so far

-fixed bug with needs_op in /place commands

-item superfood

-upgarde /searchtrade and /searchitem commands : spawn particles at the found location

- By default, the place commands no longer require OP

-effectpay : new command that gives potion effects at the cost of experience

Possible Future Features (1.4 + ):
  
-version checker

-possible refactoring
