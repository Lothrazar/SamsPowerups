STUFF FROM SPELL MOD -> OTHERS.. 


Apples - 1.1.1   released - TODO for 1.2.0 : Frost Apple (ice) , Lavawalking Apple (blaze rods crafting, BUT netherbrick color)??


Armor- cannot use emerald, there is already a popular 'emerald & obsidian' mod - need something fresh, if at all.
	?idea - lapis armor, weaker than iron, but randomly spawns exp orbs?

Beetroot - 1.0.0 released

Blocks - Rename/Rebrand as Restricted Commandblocks and/or merge with FarmingBlocks?

BucketBlocks - 1.0.0 released

CarbonPaper - 1.0.0 released

Commands - TODO: release this passed server test, ready to release (needs logo)
     ADD /villageinfo command - imported from screen text
	add allcaps versions, double check aliases etc
 TODO: i was going to look for conflicts in https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain/wiki/Commands%20Module
//but , that is only 1.7.10 so its okay
so make sure we note /reference this mod when I do the release
  ALTERNATE IDEA: the main useful stuff like home/searchx/villageinfo convert into EnderProjectiles items
  and/or we could put waypoints into OverpoweredInventory buttons, since they are saved in NBT anyway


ControlBlocks - 1.0.0 released

ControlInv -  1.0.1 released

EnderProj -  1.0.1 is now out

FancySigns - not coded yet, still prototyping. possibly add in coloured doors too if possible

FarmingBlocks - existing blocks ready for release, add a few more first or rename, 'farming' doesnt make sense

FoodDetails - 1.0.0 released

FragileTorches -  1.0.0 released

HorseFood  -  1.0.0 released

Infinitemutated / overpowered inventory - 1.0.1 released

Macros - 1.0.0 released

MobChanges - Redo the config completely (inspired by sapling growth) - for each hostile mob, list out EXTRA biomes it can spawn in

MountedPearl - 1.0.0 released

oceanFloor -  1.0.0 released

Recipes - is this interesting/fleshed out enough to release?  Do we want to put uncrafting on its own?

SaplingGrowth -  1.1.0 released

screen text aka HorseInfo - reduce to only Horses & gamerules.  how about add a config to clear right side?

SpellWheel TODO re-evaluate which spells balanced/make sense, more ideas. possibly scrap / start over / focus on potion effects / possibly extract chest sack again...
		One idea: Rebrand as POTION BELT, just consume potions into storage for later, and then use the wheel/belt to use when needed. must have control of using 5/10/30? sec at a time



Stacks - use CSV config list instead of hardcoded? does another mod exist for this? try it in postInit

TreasureBuff - TODO is this interesting/fleshed out enough to release? Do we want more config control

--bring back Screentext overhaul from 
https://github.com/PrinceOfAmber/SamsPowerups/blob/67196bb9eef092bb468a1af8ec07ba4f9d5e064d/src/main/java/com/lothrazar/samscontent/event/DebugScreenText.java


NetHandlerplayserver at processPlayerBlockPlacement
//could have a setblock event?

new mod: respawn eggs standalone. -first, fix sheep color? or drop their dye on the ground? disable villagers? what about horses/dogs?



new mod: test brewing api - frost potion & waterwalking potion





	
	-/place commands (like place floor) add a random flag  so you would enter /place floor 5 50 
				and the 50 is a 50% chance an air block gets filled with that?
	-placefloor as spiralling outward from center. Right now if you do a 5x5, it starts way off in the far corner.
	-command to place vertical - start at player feet, and go up/left/right
  
 

Spells maybes  
	-Saturation spell - 10 secondsfor high xp
	-add respawn eggs--test maybe making this a spell+projectile?
	-shrink to 1 height if possible
	- play random song
	-far reach place hotkey. use player look vectors and trickery 
	-spell for tools that cannot be repairended - allwo repair again.
	-allow spell Casting. even if hidden?
	-semicolon/spell row switching: hold shift means go in reverse order (2 1 0 not the normal)-only if we go up to 3 or more
	-REPLACE SPELL : similar to /place, but swap what you are aiming at with what youre holding. use blacklist

NATURE
	- add reeds/existing plants to ocean?

?new?-difficulty mod: smoothstone tools + furnace coal: merge this with what?
    fragile_torches  

NEW POTION AURA: EXP REGEN:
	makes you slowly gain exp over time
	-- lapis apple? makes sense since its for enchanting anyway?
