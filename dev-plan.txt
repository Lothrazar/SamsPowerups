MacrosKeys :
	- up to at least 4 from 2 custom macros. Or maybe even 9 (numpad)
	-BLOCK TOGGLE/ROTATE KEY: can we force a change smoothstone >< <> >< stone brick?
	-/place commands (like place floor) add a random flag  so you would enter /place floor 5 50 
				and the 50 is a 50% chance an air block gets filled with that?
