TODO: back up to 4 macros again?
//spell types: some use items from EI others use EXP

EXP FROM BUILDING
25% each time you place any block/thing, you get 1-3 xp randomly!?!?!?

NEW POTION AURA: EXP REGEN:
makes you slowly gain exp over time
-- lapis? makes sense since its for enchanting anyway?

ORDER SPELLS: throwables group, potion group?

ALTERNATE INTERFACE, MAYBE GRID?

BLOCK TOGGLE/ROTATE KEY: can we force a change smoothstone >< <> >< stone brick?
 

haste spell  - make it 10 seconds?

slowfall/waterwalk - make it 10 seconds?
   

/place commands (like place floor) add a random flag 
so you would enter /place floor 5 50 
and the 50 is a 50% chance an air block gets filled with that?

DONE THINGS

-frozen potion improvements

-health change configs

-debug date screen text from lang file, and better arrangement

-effectpay bugfixes: was not calculating and blocking/draining experience correctly

-10 new macro keybindings, used with new command /bind for macros
    four key bindings and a command so you can bind any command to any key.  These are 
    saved per character/world, and get reset on death.
    simply run /bind /toggledownfall or /bind /effectpay 41 10, or any other command
    and that key is now bound to the macro key (default G)

/ping : shows coordinates in chat.

/enderchest cmd bugfix (config file entries existed but not hooked up)



/effectpay: add option to pump levels (ex haste2, jump3) , make sure we default=1, and multiply XP cost by that
(then -1 since 1 = II)
