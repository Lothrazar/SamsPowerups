NEW FEATURE IDEAS /  1.1
***********
MacrosKeys :
	- up to at least 4 from 2 custom macros. Or maybe even 9 (numpad)
	-BLOCK TOGGLE/ROTATE KEY: can we force a change smoothstone >< <> >< stone brick?
	-/place commands (like place floor) add a random flag  so you would enter /place floor 5 50 
				and the 50 is a 50% chance an air block gets filled with that?
	-placefloor as spiralling outward from center. Right now if you do a 5x5, it starts way off in the far corner.
	-command to place vertical - start at player feet, and go up/left/right
  
 

Spells maybes  
	-Saturation spell
	-add respawn eggs--test maybe making this a spell+projectile?
	-shrink to 1 height if possible
	- play random song
	-far reach place hotkey. use player look vectors and trickery 
	-spell for tools that cannot be repairended - allwo repair again.
	-allow spell Casting. even if hidden?
	-semicolon/spell row switching: hold shift means go in reverse order (2 1 0 not the normal)-only if we go up to 3 or more
	-REPLACE SPELL : similar to /place, but swap what you are aiming at with what youre holding. use blacklist

NATURE
	- add reeds/existing plants to ocean?

?new?-difficulty mod: smoothstone tools + furnace coal: merge this with what?
    fragile_torches  

NEW POTION AURA: EXP REGEN:
	makes you slowly gain exp over time
	-- lapis apple? makes sense since its for enchanting anyway?
